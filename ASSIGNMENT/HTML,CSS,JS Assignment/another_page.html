<!--Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. You could name this new file another_page.html, 
 and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is.  After  you have created the new .html page, add a link to the 
first page so that the browser will load another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use the
<a> and </a> tags in this exercise. Inside the tag <a> you need to use a href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the link 
is clicked.- 5 Marks

    <h1>Effects of Global Warming</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
        Global warming has led to an incredible increase in earth’s temperature. Since 1880, the earth’s temperature has increased by ~1 degrees.
        This has resulted in an increase in the melting of glaciers, which have led to an increase in the sea level. This could have devastating 
        effects on coastal regions.
        Global warming has affected the coral reefs that can lead to a loss of plant and animal lives. Increase in global temperatures has made 
        the fragility of coral reefs even worse.
    </p>
    <p>
       Global warming has led to a change in climatic conditions. There are droughts at some places and floods at some. This climatic imbalance
        is the result of global warming.
       Global warming leads to a change in the patterns of heat and humidity. This has led to the movement of mosquitoes that carry and spread 
       diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
        A global shift in the climate leads to the loss of habitats of several plants and animals. In this case, the animals need to migrate 
        from their natural habitat and many of them even become extinct. This is yet another major impact of global warming on biodiversity.
